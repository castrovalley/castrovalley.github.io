### Coastanoan and Ohlone Indians

**Ohlone Indians**

<amp-img width="400" height="271" layout="responsive" src="/assets/images/history/ohlone1.jpg"></amp-img>
*Costanoan (Coast people) or Ohlone Indians*

> The Ohlone or Coastanoan Indians (meaning coast people, as they primarily lived along the bay and delta) were the first people to reside in the area we now call Castro Valley.
>
> European influence was not fully felt here until 1769, with the arrival of the Franciscan missionaries from Spain.

**Village Life**

<amp-img width="640" height="480" layout="responsive" src="/assets/images/history/ohlone2.jpg"></amp-img>
<amp-img width="682" height="318" layout="responsive" src="/assets/images/history/ohlone4.jpg"></amp-img>
*Depictions of a typical Ohlone Village*

> As many as 30 or 40 Ohlone villages once rimmed the shores of San Francisco Bay. Most villages consisted of between 10 to 15 families.
>
>Dome shaped houses were made from tule reeds growing in the marshlands and were gathered around a central clearing. Elevated graineries stored acorns which were ground and prepared as a mush. When the tules became dry, they would be burned and the structures rebuilt. This practice also controlled fleas and vermin.

<amp-img width="720" height="541" layout="responsive" src="/assets/images/history/ohlone3.jpg"></amp-img>
*Ohlone canoes were made of tule reeds.*

>Over 400 shell mounds, remnants of the Ohlone's sea food consumption, remained as artifacts of village life until the early 1900s, witness to a thriving population.
>
>Food was not a problem and sharing from the hunt was a point of honor in Ohlone society. Village society was cooperative rather than competitive.
>
>Villages had one or more sweat houses, dug into the ground at the edge of the village or on the downstream side of the creek. Gathering there was a ritual of reverence and purification observed before a hunt.
>
>A death brought enormous grief to the Ohlones and was cermoniously observed by wailing and tears from family and villagers both near and far. According to ritual, all possessions of the deceased: bows; blankets; medicine mortar, and more were broken or disfigured at the owner's death.

**A Land of Abundance**

<amp-img width="632" height="411" layout="responsive" src="/assets/images/history/land1.jpg"></amp-img>
*Great California grizzly bears were everywhere...roaming the beaches, feeding on berries, acorns and along stream and creeks during salmon and steelhead runs.*

> The landscape was very different in the days of the Ohlones. Marshes spread for thousands of acres, fringing the shores of the bay. The area was filled with huge flocks of waterfowl and birds.
>
> Tall bunch grasses covered vast meadowlands and tree spotted savannahs.
>
> Oak, Bay, and Redwood forests covered many of the surrounding hills.
>
> Huge herds of deer and antelope grazed the meadowslands.
Competing for game were wolf packs, grizzly bears, bob cats, mountain lions, and coyotes.
>
> A local stronghold of the Ohlones was known as the "Springs." Fairmont Hospital now stands at its site.

### The Missions: 1797

<amp-img width="632" height="411" layout="responsive" src="/assets/images/history/baptism1.jpg"></amp-img>
*Depiction of the first Baptism in upper California*

>The Franciscan Fathers founded Mission San Jose in 1797. There, they converted many of the indigenous population to Christianity and taught them agriculture, trades and other arts of their culture.
When Spanish rule in Mexico ended in 1821, the new Mexican government did not approve of the activities of the missionaries.
>
>A decree forced the Indians from the mission, the land fell into neglect and the buildings were plundered.
In 1834, 2,300 Indians remained at the mission, while others returned to village life.
>
>During this period, 1833 to 1846, many of the vast Mexican land grants were settled, changing the area the Indians had known forever.
>
>By 1842, only 400 Indians remained at the mission. These converts were demoralized. Others returned to traditional hunting and foraging in a landscape now roamed by settlers and cattle.

### Don Castro: 1838

**Don Guillermo Castro & The San Lorenzo Land Grant**

<div class="float-img i1">
<amp-img width="640" height="595" layout="responsive" src="/assets/images/history/castro1.jpg"></amp-img>
</div>
> Don Guillermo was born in California, then a Mexican possession in 1810. The son of Don Carlos Castro of Las Lagas Rancho. His birthplace was located near the village of Coyote in Santa Clara County along what is now highway 101.
>
> A career soldier, he served in the Mexican army as a lieutenant of militia at the pueblo of San Jose. In 1838, he was listed as a surveyor of government lands in San Jose, and it is about this time he acquired his land grant, roughly 28,000 acres, then known as Rancho San Lorenzo. This land  included those areas we now identify has Hayward, San Lorenzo, Castro Valley, as well as Cull, Crow and Palomares canyons. The sprawling grant encompassed about 41 square miles.

<amp-img width="939" height="1393" layout="responsive" src="/assets/images/history/castro3.jpg"></amp-img>
*A hand drawn map outlining the area of Castro's grant*

>Castro had by then married Luisa Peralta of the San Antonio Rancho, then located in East Oakland. By the time he was 28 years old, Castro was the father of seven children.
>
>Acquiring clear ownership of the land, often given as a reward for good service, was relatively simple. A request was made in writing to the governor describing the land as clearly as possible and submitting a map of the area.
>
>The grantee was required to build a home, and engage in either cattle or agricultural development. As a wedding gift, Guillermo and Luisa received 300 prime steers. He soon added 4,000 sheep and 500 horses which grazed on the rich grasses in our valley.

<amp-img width="937" height="375" layout="responsive" src="/assets/images/history/castro2.jpg"></amp-img>
*A clipping from the Sunday Tribune of Aug. 1969 describes the unearthing of Don Castro's Adobe in the 1920s.*

>Don Guillermo built an Adobe home where Hayward's Old City Hall now sits on Mission Blvd. The foundations of this home were unearthed during excavations for the building of city hall.

**A Personal Failing**

> In spite of his magnificent holdings and connections, Don Guillermo fell prey to a weakness for gambling. Selling off portions of his lands to pay gambling debts and mortgaging his property finally cost him his Rancho. Eventually, his debts culminated in a sheriff's sale in 1864.
>
> A wealthy New Englander, Faxon Dean Atherton, bought the remaining acres for $400,000. He and his family's name lives on in the San Mateo community of Atherton.
>
> Don Castro took the younger members of his family and moved to Chile in where he spent the remainder of his life.

### Early Settlers: 1848

<amp-img width="507" height="318" layout="responsive" src="/assets/images/history/goldrush1.jpg"></amp-img>
*News of gold found in California brought in droves of hopeful miners and tradespeople from the east.*

**California Gold Rush**

> The discovery of gold in California on January 24, 1848  by James Marshall at Sutter's Mill created a stampede of people to the area.
> Many were disappointed in their quest for gold but stayed on, some to purchase or squat on portions of Don Castro's Rancho.

**William Hayward**
<div class="float-img i2">
<amp-img width="293" height="375" layout="responsive" src="/assets/images/history/hayward1.jpg"></amp-img>
</div>
> Don Castro met William Hayward living at the mouth of the Palomares Canyon, where Rowell Ranch is now located.  Hayward was lured from San Francisco by stories of the rich East Bay territory.
>
> After Castro pointed out he was trespassing, the two eventually became friends. Finding that Hayward had skills in cattle ranching, Castro suggested that Hayward relocate to what is now known as Hayward. Castro sold him 56 acres of land, and Hayward built the first house at what was to become know as  'A'  Street.  "Haywards" become a flourishing town, noted for its orchards and promoted as a "resort" for visitors from Oakland and San Francisco.

### Early Settlers: 1852

**Castro Valley's Founding Families**
<div class="float-img i3">
<amp-img width="167" height="217" layout="responsive" src="/assets/images/history/atherton1.jpg"></amp-img>
</div>
> Faxton Atherton sold off Don Castro's remaining land in smaller parcels. And so, between 1852 and 1872, the valley grew.
>
> A large portion, 2,400 acres, was purchased by Misters Cull and Luce, who erected a steam operated saw mill in the area of Redwood Canyon.
>As many as nine other mills operated and harvested the redwood trees in what is now Redwood Regional park.

<amp-img width="904" height="328" layout="responsive" src="/assets/images/history/redwood.jpg"></amp-img>
*Palo Seco Sawmill, the first steam operated mill in the area, in Redwood Canyon; Redwood was hauled along Redwood Canyon on its way to the the lumber yard*

>Cull Canyon remains as a namesake of this purchase.
>Some of the old building still remain in Cull Canyon where their orchards once covered the hills.

**Jensen Ranch**

<amp-img width="1007" height="369" layout="responsive" src="/assets/images/history/jensen.jpg"></amp-img>
*The Jensen House, then and now*

> The Jensen brothers, E.R. and J.C. Jensen, purchased land in the foothills from Atherton in 1867.  A house was ready for occupancy in 1872 and was of a "salt box" design. A dormer window was added in 1882 and other additions followed in time -- a cement foundation, extra bed and bathrooms in 1939. Always well maintained, these were the only additions to the original structure.
> It is probably one of the oldest homes in Alameda county continually lived in by descendants of the original family.

### Early Settlers: 1869

<amp-img width="1200" height="913" layout="responsive" src="/assets/images/history/railroad.jpg"></amp-img>

<div class="float-img i4">
<amp-img width="300" height="320" layout="responsive" src="/assets/images/history/strobridge1.jpg"></amp-img>
</div>
>James Harvey Strobridge, a long time railroad man,  supervised construction on the Central Pacific line through the Sierra mountains and on into Utah.  After this arduous but successful task -- cutting a pass through the granite of the Sierras -- he came to the Castro Valley area with a contract to build a railroad from Niles to Oakland.
>
>Settling here, he bought 500 acres from Father Zackariah Hughes in 1869, which was known as Laurel Farms.

<amp-img width="570" height="350" layout="responsive" src="/assets/images/history/strobridge3.jpg"></amp-img>
*The Strobridge property, Laurel Farms, was located where Grove Way and Baywood are now.*

>His beautiful estate, then located on Grove Way where Baywood is, boasted its own race track and horses as well as orchards and a stately private residence.
>
>Childless, he and his wife Maria adopted three of her brother's children and two others from orphanages.

**The Strobridge House**
<div class="float-img i5">
<amp-img width="350" height="460" layout="responsive" src="/assets/images/history/strobridge2.jpg"></amp-img>
</div>
>His son E.K. Strobridge went on to become a state senator.
>
>He also had a residence in Castro Valley, originally built in 1894 for Mr. A.F. Herrick. The lovely Queen Ann Victorian eventually came to be known as the Strobridge House. It was saved from destruction and is now part of the housing complex near the Castro Valley BART station.
<amp-img width="1104" height="244" layout="responsive" src="/assets/images/history/strobridge4.jpg"></amp-img>
*The Strobridge House, built in 1894, was once surrounded by orchards and farmland; the house just prior to its rehabilitation; as it appears today.*

<a name="settlers4">

### Early Settlers: 1871

**The Stanton House**

<amp-img width="608" height="229" layout="responsive" src="/assets/images/history/stanton.jpg"></amp-img>
*The Stanton house, then and now.*

>Another early resident of Castro Valley and railroad man like Strobridge was Michael Stanton.
>He and his wife Mary purchased 500 acres of land from Mattox and Hughes off Mattox road in 1871.
>In 1873 they bought an additional 120 acres in the vicinity of where Eden Hospital now stands and built the family home.
>
>The home was moved from that location in 1973 to its present address on Norbridge Avenue. It is currently privately owned and rented as office space.
>The Stanton family had two children, John and Anita, whose names were also memorialized in Castro Valley's streets.

**Old Castro Valley Farms, Orchards, and Homes**

> A look back at the names of the Castro Valley pioneers of 1876 will include many of these family names. Others came later, buying acreage, as Strobridge and Stanton did, from the original holders. The names of these early settlers live on today in the streets of Castro Valley. Like the Stanton House, some of these early homes still exist. The Peter  Hoare property remains on Redwood Road and is now a private residence.

### Lake Chabot & Early Castro Valley: 1879

**Lake Chabot**

<amp-img width="400" height="286" layout="responsive" src="/assets/images/history/chabot1.jpg"></amp-img>
*This arial photo taken in 1936 shows Lake Chabot in the upper center of the image.*

> Anthony Chabot was called the "water wizard" when he created a 315 acre lake at the north end of Castro Valley in 1879. A crew of oriental workmen carried buckets of dirt to build the earthen dam. It was packed down daily by running herds of wild mustangs back and forth. The reservoir served as a primary source of water for the East Bay.
>
> Through the efforts of Clarence Wilson and a band of his sportsmen friends, he eventually was able to open the area for recreational use. In 1964 the park district signed a 50 lease on the 1178 acres of land and lake we now enjoy today.

*This photo shows the warehouses leveled in the "Great One," the earthquake of 1869. In the left foreground is the Hayward Hotel and in the back and to the right of the center is the Eden Congregational Church.*

> In the 1869 Earthquake, then called "The Great One," a fissure opened in the land and salt water flowed into Coyote Creek. This poisoned many of the areas wells. The Earthquake also leveled many of the buildings in what was then called "Haywards."

<amp-img width="333" height="186" layout="responsive" src="/assets/images/history/cook.jpg"></amp-img>
*Charles Cook brought many prized sheep with him from England to the tall grasses of Palomares Canyon.  Chouinard Winery is now located on part of his original estate.*

<a name="exchange">

### The Exchange - Castro Valley's First Business: 1881

<amp-img width="619" height="450" layout="responsive" src="/assets/images/history/exchange.jpg"></amp-img>

> Henry Thomford (Lucille Lorge's great-grandfather) opened what was probably the first business in Castro Valley. It was known as the Exchange and was located on the corner of Grove Way and Redwood Road (where the Presbyterian Church now stands). Mr. Thomford figured that both the drivers  who drove the dusty Dublin Road from the Livermore Valley and their horses would want to stop for a drink on there way to  the stockyards and markets in San Francisco. After the horses were watered at his troughs, the drivers would head into the saloon for a cool schooner of beer. Thomford also offered cheese, pickles, and fresh German sausages prepared by his wife. He also allowed passersby to view the three-headed chicken he kept preserved in a jar.

### "Old Town" and Old Businesses: 1920's, 30's and 40's

<amp-img width="675" height="414" layout="responsive" src="/assets/images/history/business1.jpg"></amp-img>
*Clockwise: This store stood on upper "A" Street. Here comes a Parade from Stanton Avenue on to the Castro Valley Blvd. Rexall Drugs and Kay's Creamery on the Castro Valley Blvd.. Mrs. Booth converted her brooder and tank houses into a library (where Walgreen's now stands).*

<amp-img width="605" height="202" layout="responsive" src="/assets/images/history/business2.jpg"></amp-img>
*Castro Valley Blvd.*

> Old Town Castro Valley is at the west end of Castro Valley Boulevard. It looks much the same today as it did once. The boulevard was then called Mattox Road (until the 1920s). The open field in the picture is now the site of the miniature golf course. Sheds in the field were once part of "Frehberg Collies," the kennel said to have bred the original dog who starred in "Lassie." Pete's Hardware is still in its original location on this photo and is still run by the Selmezcki family.

<amp-img width="603" height="260" layout="responsive" src="/assets/images/history/business3.jpg"></amp-img>
*Another view, looking to the East. The long barns in the photo face Castro Valley Boulevard. Stanton Avenue is at the bottom of the photo.*

<amp-img width="1003" height="462" layout="responsive" src="/assets/images/history/business4.jpg"></amp-img>
*Clockwise from left: Looking east down the Boulevard, one of our oldest buildings (once painted purple) can be seen near Redwood Road; Fritz restaurant was on the corner of Stanton and the Castro Valley Blvd; The building where Kuehn's Grocery Store once was on the Boulevard had been occupied in recent years by Perry's Creative Printing (now moved); The California State Hatchery (1934) is now the site of Connie's Tropical fish, near Stanton Boulevard; Orin Crowe's Feed Store, with its barn behind, looks very much the same today. It eventually became Nesbitts Feed Store, which closed in the late 1990s. The building is now occupied by Morrison's (Brian Morrison) Heating and Air; The lumber yard pictured here moved across the Castro Valley Blvd. where it is today.*

<amp-img width="997" height="740" layout="responsive" src="/assets/images/history/business5.jpg"></amp-img>
*Clockwise from left: The local ice cream parlor was housed in a converted street car; Valley Foods was at the corner of Redwood Rd. and Castro Valley Blvd; L&M Drive-in was on the Blvd. in 1946; Castro Valley Blvd., still familiar looking. Lucca's Delicatessen is in the center of this photo and in the same location today.*

<a name="chicken">

### When Chicken Was King: 1900-1945

> One of the most notable periods in Castro Valley's history began in the 1900s, with the ranching of chickens. At this time there were only 373 families living in 57 homes. Many of the residents were of Portugese or German heritage.

<amp-img width="649" height="399" layout="responsive" src="/assets/images/history/lundgren.gif"></amp-img>
*The Lundgren family home and ranch on Stanton Avenue was typical of ranches in the 1920s. Note the long brooder houses for chickens in the back and the orchards.*

<amp-img width="540" height="170" layout="responsive" src="/assets/images/history/alcorn.jpg"></amp-img>
*The Alcorn farmhouse was reportedly built in the 1890s.  The Alcorn’s tended to 3,000 chickens and a cow on this ranch. In the early 1900’s, George Alcorn would start the day very early in the morning, gathering eggs and sorting them in this building.  He then would take the family’s Model T truck and deliver the eggs to restaurants and hotels in Oakland and Berkeley before teaching his first class at 8 a.m. at U.C. Berkeley. He later was appointed Director of the Agricultural Extension at the University.  He made many contributions to national agricultural policy in this position.*

<amp-img width="1050" height="253" layout="responsive" src="/assets/images/history/chickens.jpg"></amp-img>
*Valley farms in the distance were a field of white dots (hens); The brooder houses, where baby chicks were born, were heated with oil fuel and often caught fire.*

<amp-img width="682" height="464" layout="responsive" src="/assets/images/history/chickens2.jpg"></amp-img>
*One of the First of some 12 hatcheries on the Castro Valley Boulevard was "Hayward Rio- Linda."  Kale was grown in a nearby field to feed the growing flocks. In the 1920s, they could hatch several thousand chicks a week. The chicks were boxed, 100 each in divided boxes and shipped all over the world. Or delivered locally by truck. In 1934, the more modern, California State Hatchery was built (Owned then by the Lorge family), near the corner of Stanton and the Boulevard.*

<amp-img width="794" height="262" layout="responsive" src="/assets/images/history/chickens3.jpg"></amp-img>
*The modern hatcherie's automatic incubators with turning racks could hatch 30,000 baby chicks a week. After 18 days in the rack, they were lowered to drawers for hatching. Besides chicken eggs, they also hatched quail and even ostrich eggs. During WWII, business was excellent due to the rationing of meat. At the end of WWII, business slowed down. Many young cockerels were colored with vegetable dye, making colorful Easter gifts. Though the colored down did grow out when feathers came in, the SPCA took a dim view of the practice and it was stopped.*

### Castro Valley Grows: 1950s-1980s
<amp-img width="682" height="340" layout="responsive" src="/assets/images/history/modern1.jpg"></amp-img>
*Barns and Tomato fields once stood where the Castro Village Shopping Center (Castro Valley Boulevard at Santa Maria Avenue) now is. The Center, developed by R.T. Nahas, was completed in 1949.*

<amp-img width="682" height="512" layout="responsive" src="/assets/images/history/modern2.jpg"></amp-img>
*This aerial view of Castro Valley was taken in 1960. Housing tracts were springing up at the end of WWII, filling in the former orchards and open fields. In this photo the surrounding foothills and canyons were still empty.*

<amp-img width="1335" height="235" layout="responsive" src="/assets/images/history/modern3.jpg"></amp-img>

*In 1951 construction started on the largest building in Castro Valley, Eden Hospital. It took 3 years to complete, opening on November 15, 1954. Eden Medical Center is located on the old Stanton family property (as well as the former Wally Glass' Pigeon Ranch and Riding Stables.) and fronts Lake Chabot Road. Eden  is now the largest employer in Castro Valley. The school district is second.*

*Rowell Ranch Rodeo Park off the 580 freeway, is believed to be the location where William Hayward was found camping by Don Castro. Now part of the East Bay Park District, it hosts an annual Rodeo. The week before, Castro Valley hosts a parade welcoming the Rodeo to town.*

*The very modern 580 freeway now cuts through Castro Valley.*

*The Bay Area Rapid Transit (Bart) runs along the 580 freeway, connecting Castro Valley to points all over the system.*

<amp-img width="557" height="375" layout="responsive" src="/assets/images/history/dragons.jpg"></amp-img>

*Our miniature golf, Golden Tee, sports a mountain of dragons.  The whimsical sculpture covers an old safe from the former tenant, Paines Realty, whose motto was "Clean Deals in Dirt."  A heavy safe of Paines was immovable, so the inventive golf course developer covered it over with concrete and the dragons.*
