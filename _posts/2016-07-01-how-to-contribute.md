<b>Submit a Github Issue</b><br>
The reccomended way to submit changes for this site is to create a <a href="https://github.com/castrovalley/castrovalley.github.io/issues">Github issue on this site's repository</a>.  You will need a Github account (free) in order to do this, and once you've created an issue you can track its response and progress through Github.

<b>Email</b><br>You can also send an email to <a href="mailto:&#099;&#097;&#115;&#116;&#114;&#111;&#118;&#097;&#108;&#108;&#101;&#121;&#103;&#105;&#116;&#104;&#117;&#098;&#064;&#103;&#109;&#097;&#105;&#108;&#046;&#099;&#111;&#109;">&#099;&#097;&#115;&#116;&#114;&#111;&#118;&#097;&#108;&#108;&#101;&#121;&#103;&#105;&#116;&#104;&#117;&#098;&#064;&#103;&#109;&#097;&#105;&#108;&#046;&#099;&#111;&#109;</a> with your suggested change.  This will automatically create a Github issue with the contents of your email. <i> Note: It may take 10-15 minutes for an issue to be created from an email.</i>
